# Team Service Schema Cleanup - Complete

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up the team service to focus solely on team and department management, removing all authentication/authorization logic that should be handled by the auth service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prisma Schema Cleanup (`services/team-service/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **REMOVED**: Role, Permission, UserRole, RolePermission models
- **KEPT**: User, Team, Department models
- **RESULT**: Schema now only contains team/department related entities

### 2. Auth Service Simplification (`services/team-service/src/services/authService.ts`)
- **REMOVED**: Role and permission querying logic
- **SIMPLIFIED**: `getUserWithRoles()` now only fetches basic user data with team/department info
- **NOTE**: Roles array is kept in response but returns empty (for API compatibility)

### 3. Type Definitions (`services/team-service/src/types/auth.ts`)
- **REMOVED**: `PermissionCheck` interface
- **SIMPLIFIED**: `AuthUser` interface kept for compatibility but roles managed by auth service
- **CLEANED**: Removed unnecessary phone field and permission checking types

### 4. RBAC Middleware (`services/team-service/src/middleware/rbac.ts`)
- **REMOVED**: `authorize()`, `requireRole()`, `requireDepartment()`, `requireTeam()`, `requireSuperAdmin()`, `requireAdmin()` methods
- **KEPT**: `authenticate()` for JWT verification and basic user fetching
- **ADDED**: Simple `requireAuth()` for ensuring authenticated requests
- **PRINCIPLE**: Complex authorization delegated to auth service

### 5. Route Protection (`services/team-service/src/routes/teamRoutes.ts`)
- **CHANGED**: All routes now use `RBACMiddleware.requireAuth()` instead of specific permission checks
- **PHILOSOPHY**: Team service verifies authentication, auth service handles authorization

## Service Boundaries

### Auth Service Responsibilities
- User authentication (login/logout)
- JWT token management
- Role and permission management
- Authorization decisions
- User CRUD operations

### Team Service Responsibilities  
- Team CRUD operations
- Department CRUD operations
- Team membership management
- Team-related data queries
- **NOT**: User authentication or authorization

## Database Schema Final State

### Team Service Database
```prisma
model User {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  email       String      @unique
  firstName   String
  lastName    String
  isActive    Boolean     @default(true)
  departmentId String?
  teamId      String?
  department  Department? @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id])
  team        Team?       @relation(fields: [teamId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt
}

model Team {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  name        String    @unique
  description String?
  isActive    Boolean   @default(true)
  users       User[]
  departmentId String
  department  Department @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Department {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  name        String    @unique
  description String?
  isActive    Boolean   @default(true)
  users       User[]
  teams       Team[]
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Team service compiles without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Auth service still compiles successfully  
- ✅ No role/permission logic remains in team service
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns between services
- ✅ Team service focused purely on team/department management

## API Impact
- Team service endpoints now require basic authentication only
- Complex authorization (who can create/edit teams) should be handled by calling auth service APIs
- Frontend should authenticate with auth service, then use that token for team service calls

## Next Steps
1. Update frontend to handle the simplified team service authorization
2. Implement authorization checks in team service by calling auth service APIs when needed
3. Test the team service endpoints with the new authentication flow
