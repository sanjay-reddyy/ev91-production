# Login Issue Resolution - Status Update

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosed
**Issue**: Super admin login showing 401 error due to database connectivity problems.

## ✅ Progress Made

### 1. Database Setup - COMPLETED
- ✅ Started PostgreSQL container (`infra-postgres-1`)
- ✅ Created complete auth service database schema
- ✅ Created super admin user with proper password hashing
- ✅ Verified database tables and data exist

### 2. Super Admin Created - READY
- **Email**: `admin@ev91.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: super_admin with all permissions
- **Status**: Successfully inserted into database

### 3. Auth Service - PARTIALLY WORKING
- ✅ Service running on port 4001
- ✅ Routes properly configured at `/api/v1/auth/*`
- ❌ Database connection authentication issues

## 🔧 Current Issue
The Prisma client in the auth service cannot authenticate with PostgreSQL, showing:
```
Authentication failed against database server at `localhost`, the database credentials for `user` are not valid.
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Solution A: Fix Prisma Connection (Recommended)
1. **Verify DATABASE_URL**: Ensure connection string matches Docker container
2. **Regenerate Prisma Client**: After database schema creation
3. **Restart Auth Service**: With fresh Prisma client

### Solution B: Alternative Authentication Test
Since the super admin exists in the database, test with direct database queries:

```sql
-- Verify super admin exists
SELECT id, email, "firstName", "lastName" FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@ev91.com';

-- Verify role assignment  
SELECT u.email, r.name as role_name 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur."userId"
JOIN roles r ON ur."roleId" = r.id 
WHERE u.email = 'admin@ev91.com';
```

## 🔗 Correct Endpoints
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:4001/health`
- **Login Endpoint**: `http://localhost:4001/api/v1/auth/login`
- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:4001/api/docs`

## 🗄️ Database Status
- **PostgreSQL**: Running and accessible
- **Tables**: All auth tables created successfully
- **Data**: Super admin user and roles populated
- **Connection**: Direct psql access working

## 🚀 Expected Resolution
Once the Prisma authentication issue is resolved, the super admin login should work with:
- Email: `admin@ev91.com`
- Password: `admin123`

The database and user setup is complete - only the service-to-database authentication needs to be fixed.
