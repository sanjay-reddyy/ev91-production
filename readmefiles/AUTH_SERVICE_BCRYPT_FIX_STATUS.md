# Auth Service bcrypt Fix Status

## Issue Summary
The auth service was experiencing native module compatibility issues with bcrypt in Alpine Linux containers.

## Problem Diagnosed
- bcrypt native binary was incompatible with Alpine Linux architecture
- Error: "Exec format error" when loading bcrypt_lib.node

## Solution Attempted
1. **Updated Dockerfile** to install build dependencies (python3, make, g++)
2. **Switched from bcrypt to bcryptjs** (JavaScript-only implementation)
3. **Updated password.ts** to import bcryptjs instead of bcrypt
4. **Added TypeScript types** for bcryptjs

## Current Status
- Container builds successfully with bcryptjs
- Container starts but has TypeScript compilation errors
- Service is not responding on port 4001

## Files Modified
- `services/auth-service/Dockerfile` - Added build dependencies and bcryptjs installation
- `services/auth-service/src/utils/password.ts` - Changed import from bcrypt to bcryptjs

## Next Steps Needed
1. Verify bcryptjs types installation in container
2. Debug TypeScript compilation errors
3. Test auth service API endpoints
4. Update any other bcrypt references in the codebase

## Test Commands
```bash
# Check container status
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps auth-service

# Check logs
docker logs infra-auth-service-1 --tail 20

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:4001/health
```

## Working Services Status
- ✅ Admin Portal: http://localhost:3001 (working)
- ⚠️ Auth Service: http://localhost:4001 (building but compilation errors)
- ✅ PostgreSQL: Running and healthy
- ✅ Other services: Available for testing

## Docker Commands Reference
```bash
# Start all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Rebuild specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build auth-service

# View all containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps
```
