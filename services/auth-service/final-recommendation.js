WHY KEEP BOTH TABLES?

üè¢ ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLEXITY:
   - Employees need department/team relationships
   - Manager/subordinate hierarchies
   - Position tracking, hire dates
   - Work-specific data (employee ID, phone)

üë• USER FLEXIBILITY:
   - Not all Users are Employees (clients, vendors, external partners)
   - Future expansion: contractors, consultants
   - Clean separation between identity and work context

üìä DATA INTEGRITY:
   - Employee organizational changes don't affect authentication
   - User login/permissions independent of job changes
   - Clear ownership of data fields

ALTERNATIVE (Single Table):
‚ùå Would require nullable fields for non-employees
‚ùå Mixed concerns in one table
‚ùå Harder to maintain organizational structure
‚ùå Less scalable for complex organizations

CONCLUSION: YES, keep both tables but remove duplication

CURRENT PROBLEM:
================
User Login ‚Üí JWT ‚Üí Multiple Auth Systems ‚Üí Confusion

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
===================
User Login ‚Üí JWT ‚Üí Single Auth (User + Employee context) ‚Üí Clean Access

MIGRATION PRIORITY:
1. HIGH: Remove duplicate fields from Employee table
2. HIGH: Consolidate routes (remove duplicate team routes)
3. HIGH: Update middleware to single auth approach
4. MEDIUM: Clean up legacy role field in User table
5. LOW: Optimize queries and add indexes

DECISION: Keep both tables with clear separation of concerns
