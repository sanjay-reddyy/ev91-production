console.log("🎉 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS SUMMARY\n");
console.log("=" * 50 + "\n");

console.log("✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:");
console.log("1. 📦 Schema Migration");
console.log("   ✓ Removed duplicate fields from Employee table");
console.log("   ✓ firstName, lastName, email, isActive now only in User table");
console.log("   ✓ Removed legacy role field from User table");
console.log("   ✓ Data backup created and restored with new schema");
console.log("   ✓ All data integrity maintained\n");

console.log("2. 🔄 Route Consolidation");
console.log("   ✓ Removed duplicate team routes from employeeRoutes.ts");
console.log("   ✓ Single source of truth: /api/v1/teams → teamRoutes.ts");
console.log("   ✓ Cleaned up imports and unused dependencies\n");

console.log("3. 🔐 Unified Authentication");
console.log("   ✓ Enhanced authMiddleware to include Employee context");
console.log("   ✓ Added requireEmployee middleware for employee-only routes");
console.log("   ✓ Updated teamRoutes to use unified authentication");
console.log("   ✓ Single authentication flow for all routes\n");

console.log("⚠️  REMAINING TASKS:");
console.log("4. 🔧 Service Layer Updates (IN PROGRESS)");
console.log("   ❌ employeeService.ts has compilation errors");
console.log("   ❌ References to removed fields need updating");
console.log(
  "   ❌ Queries must use User relation for firstName/lastName/email"
);
console.log("   ❌ Need to include User relation in all Employee queries\n");

console.log("💡 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE:");
console.log("1. Update employeeService.ts to work with new schema");
console.log("2. Update all Employee queries to include User relation");
console.log("3. Update controllers to access user data via employee.user");
console.log("4. Test all endpoints to ensure they work correctly");
console.log("5. Update any remaining references to removed fields\n");

console.log("🎯 IMPACT OF CHANGES:");
console.log("✅ Cleaner schema with no data duplication");
console.log("✅ Single authentication system");
console.log("✅ Consolidated routes with clear responsibilities");
console.log("✅ Maintainable codebase");
console.log("⚠️  Breaking changes require service layer updates\n");

console.log("RECOMMENDATION:");
console.log("The core migration is successful! The schema and routes are");
console.log("consolidated. We just need to update the service layer to");
console.log("work with the new schema structure.");
