- STATUS MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTATION
-
- This file documents the status management strategy for riders in the EV91 Platform.
-
- CURRENT STATUS FIELDS:
-
- 1.  registrationStatus:
- - Primary field for tracking registration progress
- - Values: PENDING, PHONE_VERIFIED, KYC_COMPLETED, COMPLETED
- - Used for workflow tracking and UI state management
-
- 2.  kycStatus:
- - Tracks KYC document verification status
- - Values: pending, verified, rejected, under_review
- - Used for KYC approval workflows
-
- 3.  isActive:
- - Legacy boolean field for simple active/inactive status
- - Being phased out in favor of registrationStatus
- - Currently maintained for backward compatibility
-
- MIGRATION PLAN:
-
- Phase 1: (Current)
- - Maintain both isActive and registrationStatus
- - Update both fields together for consistency
- - Frontend gradually switches to using registrationStatus
-
- Phase 2: (Next Release)
- - Add deprecation notice to isActive field
- - Update all API responses to primarily use registrationStatus
- - Include isActive for backward compatibility only
-
- Phase 3: (Future Release)
- - Remove isActive field from responses (keep in database)
- - Update all frontend components to use registrationStatus
-
- Phase 4: (Final)
- - Migrate database to remove isActive field
- - Complete transition to registrationStatus
-
- MAPPING BETWEEN FIELDS:
-
- registrationStatus: COMPLETED → isActive: true (eligible for activation)
- All other registrationStatus values → isActive: false (not eligible for activation)
-
- USAGE GUIDE:
-
- - For new code, always use registrationStatus and kycStatus
- - When updating status, make sure to update both fields if appropriate
- - For activation checks, use: registrationStatus === REGISTRATION_STATUS.COMPLETED && kycStatus === KYC_STATUS.VERIFIED
