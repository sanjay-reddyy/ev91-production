# Unified Service Request System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive vehicle service request system that has been implemented to address conflicts between vehicle service and spare parts service requests. The system provides a unified approach to managing both service scheduling and parts requests.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates

The Prisma schema has been enhanced with the following new models:

#### Core Models

- **ServiceRequest**: Main service request entity
- **ServicePartsRequest**: Parts requests associated with service requests
- **ServicePartsUsed**: Actual parts used during service
- **ServiceApproval**: Approval workflow for service requests
- **ServiceAttachment**: File attachments for service requests
- **ServiceWorkflowStep**: Workflow management
- **ServiceRequestTemplate**: Reusable service templates

#### Enums Added

- `ServiceRequestType`: PREVENTIVE, REPAIR, INSPECTION, RECALL, WARRANTY, EMERGENCY
- `ServiceRequestStatus`: DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, REJECTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- `ServiceRequestPriority`: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- `ServiceApprovalStatus`: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED
- `ServiceWorkflowStepStatus`: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, SKIPPED

### 2. Unified Service Controller

Location: `services/vehicle-service/src/controllers/UnifiedServiceController.ts`

#### Key Features:

- **Service Request Management**: Create, read, update service requests
- **Parts Integration**: Add and manage parts within service requests
- **Approval Workflow**: Handle multi-level approvals
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- **Cost Tracking**: Track estimated vs actual costs

#### Main Methods:

- `createServiceRequest()`: Creates comprehensive service requests with parts
- `getServiceRequests()`: Retrieves filtered service requests
- `getServiceRequestById()`: Get detailed service request information
- `updateServiceRequest()`: Update existing service requests
- `processApproval()`: Handle approval/rejection workflow
- `addPartsRequest()`: Add parts to existing service requests
- `recordPartsUsage()`: Record actual parts usage
- `getAnalytics()`: Generate analytics and reports

### 3. API Routes

Location: `services/vehicle-service/src/routes/unifiedService.ts`

#### Endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/unified-service/requests` - Create service request
- `GET /api/v1/unified-service/requests` - List service requests
- `GET /api/v1/unified-service/requests/:id` - Get specific request
- `PUT /api/v1/unified-service/requests/:id` - Update service request
- `POST /api/v1/unified-service/requests/:id/approval` - Process approval
- `POST /api/v1/unified-service/requests/:id/parts` - Add parts request
- `POST /api/v1/unified-service/requests/:id/parts/usage` - Record parts usage
- `GET /api/v1/unified-service/analytics` - Get analytics

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Unified Service Request Form

Location: `apps/admin-portal/src/components/UnifiedServiceRequestForm.tsx`

#### Features:

- **Multi-tab Interface**: Basic Info, Service Details, Parts & Materials
- **Service Type Selection**: All service types with appropriate forms
- **Parts Integration**: Search and add parts from spare parts inventory
- **Cost Calculation**: Real-time cost estimation
- **Symptoms Tracking**: Pre-defined and custom symptoms
- **Approval Workflows**: Customer approval requirements

#### Key Components:

- Service type and priority selection
- Date and location scheduling
- Parts search and selection with quantity/pricing
- Symptoms multi-select with autocomplete
- Real-time cost calculation

### 2. Unified Service Dashboard

Location: `apps/admin-portal/src/components/UnifiedServiceDashboard.tsx`

#### Features:

- **Statistics Cards**: Total requests, pending, in-progress, completed, total cost
- **Advanced Filtering**: By status, type, priority, search terms
- **Service Request Table**: Comprehensive view with actions
- **Approval Actions**: Approve/reject directly from dashboard
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export functionality

#### Management Features:

- Real-time statistics
- Status-based filtering
- Bulk operations
- Detailed view dialogs
- Edit functionality

## Integration Points
