/**
 * Test Cases for Active/Inactive Status Filter
 *
 * 1. Filter by "Active" status (isActive === true)
 * - Expected: Only riders with isActive === true should be displayed
 *
 * 2. Filter by "Inactive" status (isActive === false)
 * - Expected: Only riders with isActive === false should be displayed
 *
 * 3. Clear Active/Inactive filter
 * - Expected: Riders with any active status should be displayed
 */

/**
 * Test Cases for Combined Filters
 *
 * 1. Filter by "completed" registration status AND "verified" KYC status
 * - Expected: Only riders that match BOTH criteria should be displayed
 *
 * 2. Filter by "pending" registration status AND "Active" status
 * - Expected: Only riders that match BOTH criteria should be displayed
 *
 * 3. Filter by "verified" KYC status AND "Inactive" status
 * - Expected: Only riders that match BOTH criteria should be displayed
 *
 * 4. Filter by all three filters at once
 * - Expected: Only riders that match ALL criteria should be displayed
 */

/**
 * Test Cases for Filter Reset
 *
 * 1. Apply multiple filters, then click "Clear Filters" button
 * - Expected: All filters should be reset and all riders should be displayed
 *
 * 2. Apply filters, navigate away, then return to the page
 * - Expected: Filters should be reset (or preserved, depending on your requirements)
 */

/**
 * Test Cases for Filter with Pagination
 *
 * 1. Apply filters with a result set that spans multiple pages
 * - Expected: Pagination should work correctly with filtered results
 *
 * 2. Navigate between pages with filters applied
 * - Expected: Filtered results should be maintained across page navigation
 */

/**
 * How to Run These Tests
 *
 * 1. Apply each filter combination manually in the RiderManagement UI
 * 2. Check the console logs for:
 *    - Applied filter values sent to API
 *    - Received data properties
 *    - Status counts to verify filter effectiveness
 * 3. Visually verify that the table displays only the expected riders
