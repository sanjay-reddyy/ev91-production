# Vehicle Stats Endpoint Implementation - EV91 Platform

## Issue Resolved: Missing `/vehicles/stats` Endpoint

### Problem Description
The frontend was calling `/api/v1/vehicles/stats` but this endpoint was not implemented in the backend, resulting in 404 errors with "Vehicle not found" because the route was being interpreted as `/vehicles/:id` where `id = "stats"`.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Vehicle Stats Controller Function
**File:** `services/vehicle-service/src/controllers/vehicleController.ts`

Added `getVehicleStats` function that provides comprehensive vehicle statistics:

```typescript
export const getVehicleStats = asyncHandler(async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) => {
  // Implementation includes:
  // - Total vehicle count
  // - Vehicles grouped by operational status
  // - Vehicles grouped by service status  
  // - Top vehicle models by count
  // - Age distribution (new, moderate, old, vintage)
  // - Mileage statistics (average, min, max)
});
```

**Statistics Provided:**
- ✅ **Total Vehicles**: Count of all vehicles in the fleet
- ✅ **Status Distribution**: Breakdown by operational status (Available, Assigned, etc.)
- ✅ **Service Status**: Breakdown by service status (Active, Inactive, etc.)
- ✅ **Top Models**: Most popular vehicle models with OEM details
- ✅ **Age Distribution**: Fleet age analysis (new/moderate/old/vintage)
- ✅ **Mileage Stats**: Average, minimum, and maximum mileage

#### 2. Added Route Configuration
**File:** `services/vehicle-service/src/routes/vehicles.ts`

- ✅ Added import for `getVehicleStats` function
- ✅ Added `/stats` route BEFORE the `/:id` route (critical for proper routing)
- ✅ Added Swagger documentation for the endpoint
- ✅ Configured with `optionalAuth` middleware

**Route Definition:**
```typescript
router.get('/stats', optionalAuth, getVehicleStats);
```

#### 3. Updated Environment Configuration
**File:** `apps/admin-portal/.env`

- ✅ Set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4003/api/v1` (was empty)
- ✅ Ensured consistency with `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalVehicles": 0,
    "vehiclesByStatus": {
      "Available": 5,
      "Assigned": 10,
      "Under Maintenance": 2
    },
    "vehiclesByServiceStatus": {
      "Active": 15,
      "Inactive": 2
    },
    "topModels": [
      {
        "modelId": "...",
        "count": 5,
        "modelName": "Ather 450X",
        "oemName": "Ather Energy"
      }
    ],
    "ageDistribution": {
      "new": 5,
      "moderate": 8,
      "old": 3,
      "vintage": 1
    },
    "mileageStats": {
      "average": 15000,
      "maximum": 45000,
      "minimum": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

### Test Results

✅ **All Endpoints Working (100% Success Rate):**
1. OEMs Management
2. Vehicle Models  
3. Vehicles List
4. **Vehicle Stats** (newly implemented)
5. OEM Stats
6. Vehicle Model Metadata

### Benefits

1. ✅ **Dashboard Analytics**: Enables comprehensive fleet dashboard
2. ✅ **Fleet Management**: Provides operational insights for decision making
3. ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Track fleet utilization and status
4. ✅ **Maintenance Planning**: Age and mileage insights for service scheduling
5. ✅ **Business Intelligence**: Model popularity and OEM performance data

### Usage

```javascript
// Frontend usage
const response = await vehicleService.getVehicleStats();
console.log(`Total vehicles: ${response.data.totalVehicles}`);
```

```bash
# Direct API call
curl http://localhost:4003/api/v1/vehicles/stats
```

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Vehicle stats endpoint - COMPLETED
2. ✅ API routing fixes - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ Frontend integration - COMPLETED
4. Ready for dashboard implementation with real-time stats
